This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Run the Dev server:
Assuming you have a recent version of node installed you can run the dev server with: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Continued Work

I wanted to continue a bit further after my alotted time so I put changes on the **finish-up** branch. Adding Jest tests would be my next step before rounding out on the deploy step. However, normally I would test in parallel with development.
